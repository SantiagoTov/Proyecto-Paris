# CRITICAL RULES

1.  **Material UI (MUI) is MANDATORY.**
    - You must use `@mui/material` components for all UI elements.
    - You must use the `sx` prop or `styled` API for custom styling.
    - Do NOT suggest or use Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, or plain CSS/SCSS files unless specifically requested for global resets that MUI CssBaseline doesn't cover.

2.  **TypeScript & React**
    - Use functional components with hooks.
    - Ensure strict typing.

3.  **Code Style**
    - Clean, modern, and accessible code.
    - Use `Box`, `Stack`, `Grid`, `Typography` from MUI for layout and text.
